# Hi there!

You're probably looking for my Codeberg or GitLab profiles (see linked on the left of the GitHub profile).

I only have a GitHub account because it's needed for some purposes.

I dislike GitHub, among other reasons because of their forced "AI" and its scraping of repos regardless their license or private status. (If you haven't heard of that, it's worth looking into.) I used like GitHub before they started to go down these roads.
